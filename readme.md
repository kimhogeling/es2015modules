# what is this?

this is an experiment to get familiar with ES6 modules.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
`npm run` starts a SimpleHTTPServer in python and also runs gulp.
the result can be seen in the browser http://0.0.0.0:3000

the js source files lie in `./src/js`

the transpiled cross-browser files are saved into `./public/js`
