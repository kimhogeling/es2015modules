# what is this?

This is small prototype to get familiar with ES6 modules.

```bash
npm install
npm start
```
This starts a SimpleHTTPServer in python and also runs gulp.
The result can be seen in the browser http://0.0.0.0:3000

The js source files lie in `./src/js`

The transpiled cross-browser files which are used in the browser are saved into `./public/js`
