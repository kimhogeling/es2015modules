# about the public folder

## js
You should not see a js file in git, but you should after running gulp, because it is the destination folder for the transpiled cross-browser files. The js source files lie in `../src/js`

## css
The css does not lie in the `../src` folder, instead it is here.
That is because this experiment is not relevant for css and I didn't want to pollute the gulpfile.
